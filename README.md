# SansuDrillerEnglishPatch

Hello! This is an English translation patch for Sansu Driller

Copy the contents of the zip to your atmosphere\contents folder.

It should look like this:

SDROOT\atmosphere\contents\01005C3014DA8000\romfs\Data\ *files*

Enjoy the game!

Special thanks to nesrak ( https://github.com/nesrak1 ) for helping me get over a super weird texture issue with Unity
